somethings wrong with adding players to the room.player correctly in the back end. 

figure out why adding/removing a person isn't working correctly.
 

issues: 
  2. rooms being displayed multiple times on home screen 
  2c. also add a join message


...on room delete, send out message to update rooms...


//rewrite create room logic to make use of ng-repeat
