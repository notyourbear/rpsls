1. fix the stupid bug where if a third person enters before the second person joins the game it does't update.
  -probably just need to broadcast to the entire room whats going on.

2. make it so that after playing the game pressing the buttons won't do a thing anymore
  -add another element to the profile that click happened

3. make the winning message actually be a count down timer that then also resets the game

4. add a way to back out back to the main room
